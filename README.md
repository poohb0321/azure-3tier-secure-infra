## 🧱 Architecture Summary

This project delivers a secure, scalable **3-tier cloud architecture** on Microsoft Azure, fully provisioned through **modular Terraform code** and maintained through a secure **CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps**. It follows security best practices based on **Zero Trust principles**, offering end-to-end protection for web applications, workloads, and data.

---

### 🧩 3-Tier Model

- **Web Tier**:
  - Exposed via a **Public IP** connected to an **Azure Application Gateway with WAF (Web Application Firewall)**.
  - Responsible for routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic securely to backend services while applying OWASP security rules.

- **App Tier**:
  - Hosted on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** integrated with **Azure CNI** for subnet-level network control.
  - Uses **Workload Identity** to access Azure resources securely without credentials.
  - Supports microservices and containerized workloads with built-in scalability.

- **Data Tier**:
  - Comprised of **private Azure storage or database services**.
  - Access is limited to internal subnets using **Private Endpoints** and DNS zone integrations.

---

### 🛠️ Tooling

- **Terraform**: Automates infrastructure provisioning using reusable modules for VNet, AKS, WAF, Key Vault, etc.
- **Azure DevOps**: Manages CI/CD pipelines for Terraform with secure backend, linting, and approval workflows.
- **tfsec**: Integrates static code analysis into the pipeline to catch misconfigurations before deployment.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Provides CSPM, threat detection, and secure configuration recommendations.
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Offers SIEM capabilities, alerting, and integration with Logic Apps for incident response.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Automates security response (e.g., email alerts on incidents triggered by Sentinel rules).

---

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Network Segmentation**:
  - Uses **NSGs (Network Security Groups)** and **UDRs (User Defined Routes)** to isolate web, app, and data tiers.
  - Traffic from app and data tiers is routed through an **Azure Firewall** for inspection and logging.

- **Private Endpoints**:
  - Key Vault, storage, and database resources are accessible only through private IPs within the VNet.
  - **Private DNS zones** configured to support name resolution for private resources.

- **Azure Firewall**:
  - Deployed as a centralized egress control point.
  - Logs and monitors outbound traffic from app and data subnets.

- **Microsoft Sentinel + Logic App**:
  - Sentinel detects security events (e.g., Key Vault deletion).
  - Logic App automates incident responses such as email alerts or ticket creation.

- **Identity and Access Management**:
  - RBAC roles assigned via Terraform to enforce least privilege.
  - AKS workloads use **federated Workload Identity** to access Key Vault securely.
  - No hardcoded secrets or access policies used; everything managed via **Entra ID + Terraform**.

---

This architecture is built to be **highly secure**, **modular**, and **production-grade**, supporting modern DevSecOps practices and ready for enterprise deployment.
